# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.ts
```
In order to deploy contract you need to add .env file with following configuration:

```shell
INFURA_API_KEY=""
GOERLI_PRIVATE_KEY=""
ETHERSCAN_API_KEY=""
PRIVATE_KEY=""
```
Contract deployed on Goerli with address: 0x2b8e770134daf7F35ec0F5ef5d7C48fa3d6f277d
